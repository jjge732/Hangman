# Word-Guess-Game
 A fully functional game of hangman created using vanilla JavaScript. It is played by typing keys to guess letters. Incorrect responses cause another piece of the hangman to be assembled. If the hangman is fully assembled, the player loses the game. If the word is typed out to completion, they win.
